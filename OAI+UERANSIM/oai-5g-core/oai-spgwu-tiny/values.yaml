## In case of using these charts on Openshift then please use UBI images

#service type is fixed to clusterIP, it is only support for non multus interface (eth0)
service:
  pfcpPort: 8805 # default port no need to change unless necessary
  gtpuPort: 2152 # default port no need to change unless necessary

# create an extra interface for N3 incase the gNB is outside the cluster network or there is a need to have dedicated interface for N3
## Change these ip-addresses according to your environment
## N4, N6 are optional only if you want that UPF uses different subnets for different 3gpp interfaces.
